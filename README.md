# Experience: I recently earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Management Information Systems from the Fowler College of Business at San Diego State University. My education had a focused emphasis on Data Analytics and Analysis, Cybersecurity, and Machine Learning. My academic journey has been complemented by hands-on experiences, shaping me into a versatile and skilled professional.

# Bolstered by a Cisco certification in Network and Cybersecurity Essentials along with an in process Google Data Analysis certification, I have exhibited my commitment to mastering the dynamic field of cybersecurity and data analysis. Proficient across a spectrum of programming languages and tools, including Excel, SQL, HTML, Python, Tableau, PowerBI, and RapidMiner, I am well-equipped to harness the potency of data for transformative insights.

# My growth isn't confined to academia alone; it is deeply rooted in practical exposure across diverse sectors. During my tenure at Mutual of Omaha Mortgage as an intern, I led a dynamic team through the meticulous organization of over 3,000 unique documents. My responsibilities spanned data entry, analytics projects, and close collaboration with the funding and post-closing departments. From my role as a cashier at Dengeos Restaurant to a campaign intern at Matt Gurtler's Campaign, I've cultivated invaluable skills in customer service, communication, and teamwork.

# With my sights set on securing a full-time role that harmonizes seamlessly with my passions and capabilities, I am open to opportunities in both in-person, hybrid, and remote work environments. Whether situated in San Diego, CA or accessible remotely across the United States, I am ready to contribute meaningfully.
